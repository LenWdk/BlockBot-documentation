Abstract
========

This document describes the file and message formats used
to store and transmit brick information and
other informations like robot telemetry.

Packet formats
==============

Common
------

Multiple byte fields are stored in network byte
order.

Each packet starts with a 16bit type field and
a 16bit length field to keep the protocol extensible
and agnostic to unkown packet types.

Type fields
-----------

    Number | Mnemonic   | Description
    -------+------------+-------------
    0x0001 | CHAIN_AQ   | Aquisition request
           |            |
    0x0100 | BRICK_CONT | Brick container
    0x0101 | BRICK_NAME | Human readable name of a brick
    0x0102 | BRICK_BC   | The machine readable bytecode
    0x0103 | BRICK_PREP | Determines which bytecode bytes are parameters
           |            |
    0x0200 | TMTY_BRNR  | Telemetry feedback about the currently executed brick
    0x0201 | TMTY_BAT   | Feedback about the battery status
           |            |
    0x0300 | PGM_DATA   | Request brick reprogramming
    0x0301 | PGM_STAT   | brick reprogramming status feedback
           |            |
    0xff00 | ERR_TX     | Checksum missmatch or timeout occured

CHAIN_AQ
------

    CHAIN_AQ (16bit) | Length (16bit) | Checksum (16bit) | Payload

An aquisition request is a conatiner packet used to describe and
collect a complete brick chain.

An aquisition request packet may contain an arbitrary number of
subpackets as long as the length field can still contain the complete
length.

Upon receivial of an `CHAIN_AQ` packet a ...

- ... hop containing a bytecode should prepend a packet of type
  `BRICK_CONT` or `BRICK_BC` to the payload of the packet and update
  the checksum and length field before forwarding the packet to the next hop.

- ... hop that does not contain bytecode or executes programs
  should forward the packet unchanged.
  The checksum may be checked.

- ... hop that executes programs should store the bytecode to its
  bytecode buffer and optionally start executing it.
  The hop should also check the checksum and return a ERR_TX packet
  if it did not match.

BRICK_CONT
----------

    BRICK_CONT (16bit) | Length (16bit) | Payload

A brick container contains all informations regarding a physical brick.
This is the prefered packet kind a brick hop should prepend to the
payload of a `CHAIN_AQ` packet.

BRICK_NAME
----------

    BRICK_NAME (16bit) | Length (16bit) | Brick name (1-8 bytes)

This packet may only occur in `BRICK_CONT` containers and sets the
human readable name of said container.
The length of the name should not exceed 8 bytes and should consist
exclusively of ASCII characters.

BRICK_BC
--------

    BRICK_BC (16bit) | Length (16bit) | Bytecode

This packet may only occur in `BRICK_CONT` containers and sets the
bytecode of said container.
The bytecode format is specified in the _bytecode_ document.

BRICK_PREP
----------

    BRICK_PREP (16bit) | Length (16bit) | Parameter number (16bit) | Replace addresses nÂ·(16bits)

This packet may not be forwarded to other hops.

This packet tells a brick unit which bytes in the bytecode should be replaced
by parameters that can be set by input devices (potentiometer, switch) on the
brick.

TMTY_BRNR
---------

    TMTY_BRNR (16bit) | Length (16bit) | Brick number (16bit)

This packet provides feedback feedback about the currently executed
brick number and may be used to provide program flow feedback to the user.

It should be forwarded to the previos brick with an active connection.

TMTY_BAT
--------

    TMTY_BAT (16bit) | Length (16bit) | Battery status (16bit)

This packet provides an estimation of the battery status of a hop.
A value of 0xffff should correspond to a full battery, a value of
0x0000 to a completely dead one.

PGM_DATA
--------

    PGM_DATA (16bit) | Length (16bit) | EEPROM data

This packet requests the receiving brick to reprogram its
brick descriptor.

Upon successfull programming or when an error occurs the brick
should send a `PGM_STAT` packet.

PGM_STAT
--------

    PGM_STAT (16bit) | Length (16bit) | status code (16bit)

This packet is a response to a `PGM_DATA` programming request.

The `status code` field may be one of the following

    0x0000 | STATUS_OK    | Reprogramming performed sucessfully
    0x0001 | STATUS_NOMEM | Internal memory not sufficient to store program


ERR_TX
------

    ERR_TX (16bit) | Length (16bit) | Generating packet type (16bit)

This packet should be sent back to the other peer, when an error
occures while receiving a message.

When no back channel is available the error report may be omitted.

Examples
========

Brick EEPROM
------------

    01 00 00 23              | Brick container header containing brick descriptor length
    01 01 00 03 46 77 64     | Brick name "Fwd"
    01 03 00 04 00 00 00 03  | Replace byte 4 of the bytecode with potentiometer value
    01 02 00 0c 09 40 0a 00  | 12 bytes of Bytecode
    e1 e5 f2 d3 a3 31 e0 e4  |

Aquisition (first hop, brick as seen above)
----------------------

    00 01 00 29 f8 21        | Chain aquisition header containing full length an checksum
    01 00 00 23              | Brick container header containing brick descriptor length
    01 01 00 03 46 77 64     | Brick name "Fwd"
    01 02 00 0c 09 40 0a 10  | Parameter packet is missing. And byte four is replaced
    e1 e5 f2 d3 a3 31 e0 e4  | by the potentiometer value in the bytecode.
